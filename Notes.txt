+ You cannot print a js object as text in React (component)
const obj = { text: 'hello' }
> { obj }

+ in class component: the constructor is needed to get access to states

+ you can only set state like: this.state = { ... } in constructors. Other times must be setState

+ with introduction of Hooks, you can use const {foo, setFoo} = useState(bar);

+ to call an action to redux, there is no point doing something like
	foo()

+ The action has to be sent to the connect function to be dispatched

+ An action is alway passed to the
	connect(mapStateToProps, { foo })(bar)

+ import default_export, { named_export } from ...

+ on async/await action functions does not return a valid js object but instead a promise. Need to use a middleware to deal with it (this course uses redux-thunk)

+ using redux-thunk, action creators can return funtions in addition to action objects. The functions will get passed to dispatch and getState, wait for the request to finished, before getting to reducers.

+ TECHNICALLY you can change state inside a reducer. However the way redux work is that, as long as you're returning that same same from parameter, redux will not see that as a change.
- return a new object instead

+ might want to revise chp 189-191 for the fetching and memoize

+ the create-react-app dev server will return index if it can't find a route unless configured. Unlike tranditional server that returns a 404.
